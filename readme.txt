=======================================================================================
When a game gets a new DLC you have to download that new DLC and:
- with game config autoupdates you don't have to do anything
- without autoupdates redownload the Unlocker and run the setup script again
Autoupdates are by default enabled for The Sims 4, you can change that in "config.ini".

When a game gets a new update you don't have to do absolutely anything.
When Origin updates you don't have to do absolutely anything.
